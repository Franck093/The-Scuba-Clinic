                    <br>
                    <p>The Scuba Clinic was created to provide the diving public with a professional, honest,
                        reliable place to bring their scuba equipment, to be kept in top working order.

                        <p>The only focus of the Scuba Clinic is Servicing and Repairs, enabling us to provide a level of service second to none.  Without
                            the day to day interruptions that usually occur within a dive shop, scuba servicing can be completed without cutting corners or 
                            the risk of errors.

                        <br>
                        <p>After many years of servicing scuba equipment, we have heard of and seen a large variance of service standards throughout 
                           Australia.  The Scuba Clinic's goal is to lift the standard of scuba servicing to the professional level we believe it should be.

                        <p>The Scuba Clinic is owned and run by Ian Wolverson.  For over 17 years Ian has looked after the scuba equipment of many
                           hundreds of sport divers and also numerous government departments.  Ian has certificates from every available scuba 
                           equipment manufacturer and is also a level 3 Senior Technician / Trainer with TQS (Technicians Qualification System).
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Ian started diving in 1985 and has dived much of South Australia, including 18 years as an active cave diver with the Cave 
                           Divers Association of Australia.  With this experience Ian understands the needs of both recreational and technical divers
                           alike.  Whilst working with numerous government departments he also understands the needs of working divers and 
                           occupational health and safety requirements.

                             the technician pulling apart your gear. </p>
