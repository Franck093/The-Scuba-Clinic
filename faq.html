                    <br>
                    <p class="answerFaq"><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp; NO, THE HYDRO TEST PROCEDURE IS ONLY FOR THE CYLINDER.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="questionFaq"><strong>Q.</strong>&nbsp; DOES MY VALVE NEED SERVICING EVERY YEAR?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="answerFaq"><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp; NOT EVERY YEAR NECESSARILY, BUT EVERY 2 TO 3 YEARS IS RECOMMENDED AS YOUR VALVE HOLDS BACK FULL CYLINDER PRESSURE AND ALSO HAS A BURST DISK FOR SAFETY THAT SHOULD BE REPLACED.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p class="answerFaq"><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp; ABSOLUTELY. YOUR BCD IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR SYSTEM AND CAN LET YOU DOWN BY LEAKING, SELF INFLATING, OR BEING PUNCTURED FROM HARD SALT CRYSTALS INSIDE THE BLADDER. ALSO MANY BCDs TODAY HAVE AN ALTERNATE AIR SOURCE, WHICH BECOMES YOUR OCTOPUS.</p>

                        <p class="questionFaq"><strong>Q.</strong>&nbsp; HOW OFTEN SHOULD I GET MY REGULATORS SERVICED?</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="answerFaq"><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp; MOST MANUFACTURERS RECOMMEND EVERY 12 MONTHS, SOME ARE 24 MONTHS. IF YOU ARE UNSURE, PLEASE CONTACT US WITH YOUR BRAND OF GEAR FOR THE CORRECT ANSWER.  IF YOU DIVE A LOT, OR ARE UNABLE TO WASH YOUR EQUIPMENT THOROUGHLY, YOU MAY WANT TO GET IT SERVICED MORE OFTEN.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="questionFaq"><strong>Q.</strong>&nbsp; CAN THE SCUBA CLINIC SERVICE MY GEAR THAT HAS <strong><em>PARTS FOR LIFE</em></strong> WARRANTY, EVEN THOUGH I PURCHASED IT SOMEWHERE ELSE?</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="answerFaq"><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp; ABSOLUTELY YES. THESE BRANDS ONLY REQUIRE YOUR EQUIPMENT BE SERVICED BY AN AUTHORISED TECHNICIAN. THE SCUBA CLINIC HOLDS CERTIFICATIONS FOR ALL MAJOR BRANDS. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="questionFaq"><strong>Q.</strong>&nbsp; MY DIVE GEAR IS OLD, IS IT WORTH GETTING IT SERVICED?</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="answerFaq"><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp; IN MANY CASES YES. MOST BRANDS OF GEAR STILL HAVE PARTS AVAILABLE FOR OLDER MODELS, AND SERVICING WILL WORK OUT CHEAPER THAN BUYING NEW. THE SCUBA CLINIC CAN GIVE YOU A FREE QUOTE BEFORE COMMENCING ANY SERVICE WORK.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="questionFaq"><strong>Q.</strong>&nbsp; HOW DO I KNOW MY GEAR IS BEING LOOKED AFTER BY A PROFESSIONAL TECHNICIAN?</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="answerFaq"><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp; YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO ASK TO SEE A CURRENT CERTIFICATE FOR YOUR BRAND OF DIVE GEAR. YOU CAN ALSO ASK TO SEE THE SERVICE LAB WHERE THE WORK WILL TAKE PLACE. YOUR QUALIFIED TECHNICIAN SHOULD ALSO HAVE NO PROBLEM CHATTING TO YOU ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="questionFaq"><strong>Q.</strong>&nbsp; WHAT HAPPENS TO MY OLD PARTS THAT ARE REPLACED DURING SERVICING?</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="answerFaq"><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp; THIS DEPENDS. IF YOU ARE IN A <strong><em>PARTS FOR LIFE</em></strong>  PROGRAM, THE OLD PARTS WILL HAVE TO BE RETURNED TO THE WHOLESALER FOR CREDIT. ANY PARTS THAT YOU PAY FOR, SHOULD BE OFFERED BACK TO YOU, OR DISPOSED OF IN FRONT OF YOU AS PROOF OF REPLACEMENT.  </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="questionFaq"><strong>Q.</strong>&nbsp; DOES MY EQUIPMENT NEED SPECIAL CLEANING FOR NITROX USE?</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="answerFaq"><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp; MOST REGULATOR BRANDS WILL ACCEPT NITROX UP TO 40% PROVIDED THEY ARE SERVICED WITH NO SILICONE OR GREASE AND ARE IN GOOD CONDITION. FOR MIXES ABOVE 40%, THE REGULATOR IS CLASSED AS AN O2 REGULATOR, AND MUST BE SERVICED OR CONVERTED ACCORDINGLY. CYLINDERS AND VALVES WILL DEPEND ON HOW YOUR NITROX IS FILLED. PLACES THAT FIRST FILL THE CYLINDER WITH PURE O2, WILL NEED EVERYTHING O2 CLEANED, PLACES WITH MEMBRANE TYPE SYSTEMS MAY NOT. REMEMBER IF YOU DO NOT O2 CLEAN, YOU ARE RESTRICTED TO A MEMBRANE ONLY FILL STATION.  </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="questionFaq"><strong>Q.</strong>&nbsp; WHAT WILL IT COST TO ADJUST MY SECOND STAGE, A SMALL LEAK HAS DEVELOPED; IT HAS BEEN A LITTLE WHILE SINCE IT WAS SERVICED?</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="answerFaq"><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp; NO CHARGE, IF YOUR GEAR WAS SERVICED BY US, AND ANY LEAKS APPEAR BEFORE THE NEXT DUE SERVICE, WE WILL RE-TUNE THE REGULATOR FOR FREE. BECAUSE YOUR SERVICE IS ALWAYS DONE ON THE PREMISES, WE CAN USUALLY DO THE ADJUSTMENT ON THE SPOT WHILE YOU WAIT.</p>
